Some basic programs in computer version learning,for beginer to better understand CV and OpenCV.
To begin with you can find all the paper here:

##This repo contains relement of these papers.
### 1. code for seam-carving (just for learning) 2017.11.29


### 2. code for possion image editing  2017.11.29


### 3. code for image sythesis 2018.4.14


### 4. branch photometricstereo :code for photometricstereo (lightdirection is the txt file which contains the light direction parameters of this program,it work with the image {pts[i]})
